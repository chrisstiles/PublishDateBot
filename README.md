# PublishDateBot

A Reddit bot that checks linked articles and attempts to parse out the original publication date. The goal is to help users avoid being mislead by outdated articles. 

This bot uses basically the same date parsing code I wrote for the [Reddit Publish Date Chrome Extension](https://github.com/chrisstiles/Reddit-Publish-Date).
